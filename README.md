# Oregon Wine Scores

Working in the wine indsutry, there is a big debate over what factors contribute to a wine receving a low or high score from a critic. Since the wines are tasted blind by reviewers, factors such as advertising spend, producer reputation or the price of the wine should not feature when the wines are evaluated. My goal was to create a tool that enables consumers and profucers to search for any published wine score, with accompanying review, on the Wine Enthusiast (winemag.com) website. 

Using the selenium package for python, I scraped all of the reviews for all of Oregon producers going back to 1989. The resulting tool was created using Google Data Studio.
